Kezuri is [Sharpen](https://sharpen.com)'s design system. A collaboration of
our User Experience and Engineering teams, Kezuri helps us design and deliver
user interfaces that are usable, accessible, consistent, and beautiful.

## Kezuri's structure

* **Design Tokens** point to basic style values like colors, fonts, and measurements.
* **Utilities** are common styles that are used across components.
* **Atoms** serve as the foundational building blocks of all our user interfaces, like form inputs and buttons.
* **Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.
* **Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules, atoms, or other organisms.
* **Pages** are comprehensive examples of our components at work in real or prototyped scenarios.

For more background on this methodology, see [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) by Brad Frost.
