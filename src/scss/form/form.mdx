# Forms

We use these utility classes to ensure more consistent rendering of forms
across browsers and devices.

Be sure to use an appropriate `type` attribute on all inputs (e.g. `email` for
email address or `number` for numerical information) to take advantage of newer
input controls like email verification, number selection, and more.

## Form accessibility

Ensure that all form controls have an appropriate accessible name so that
their purpose can be conveyed to users of assistive technologies. The simplest
way to achieve this is to use a `<label>` element, or &ndash; in the case of
buttons &ndash; to include sufficiently descriptive text as part of the
`<button>...</button>` content.

For situations where it's not possible to include a visible `<label>` or
appropriate text content, there are alternative ways of still providing an
accessible name, such as:

* Pointing to an existing element that can act as a label using aria-labelledby
* Providing a title attribute
* Explicitly setting the accessible name on an element using aria-label

If none of these are present, assistive technologies may resort to using the
`placeholder` attribute as a fallback for the accessible name on `<input>` and
`<textarea>` elements.

## Form field instructions

Pair a form field with a `sharpen-form-text` element to show special instructions.

<Canvas of={FormStories.FieldInstructions} />

## Displaying multiple fields

Wrap each field's elements with a `sharpen-form-group` element to apply the
appropriate vertical spacing between each field.

<Canvas of={FormStories.FormGroups} />

## Field errors

Add the `sharpen-form-error` class to your `sharpen-form-group` and all its
inner elements will get the right styling to highlight a validation error.

## Displaying a legal document within a form

When you need to present a legal document to a user for their review and
approval, use the `sharpen-form-document` class to contain it within a
nicely-styled scrollable box.

<Canvas of={FormStories.FormDocument} />

## Survey-style form questions

In surveys, wizards, and assessments, where users are providing mostly
one-click responses to questions, we use a button style of radio and checkbox
input that's easier to click and can hold multiple lines of text.

### Horizontal questions

### Vertical questions
