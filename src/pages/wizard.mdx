# Onboarding Wizard

## Radio Question

* Note that, in this example, the wizard header is not configured with a
  `back-href` attribute since it is the first question and thus no back button
  should be displayed.
* Radio questions, unless specified otherwise, should be built to save the
  user's answer and advance to the next question automatically when an option
  is clicked.

## Checkbox Question

* Because checkbox questions allow the user to select 0, 1, or more options,
  we display a submit button at the bottom and only advance to the next 
  question when the user clicks it.

## Email Question

* Even though the Wizard flow has a distinct style, it is still built on top of 
  Kezuri; therefore, we can use text input fields and show field-level
  validations as usual.
* Because the we intend to keep the user focused on one goal during this wizard,
  we try to avoid including links that might take the user elsewhere. We must,
  however, provide access to the Terms and Privacy Policy. These links should
  open in a new browser tab (i.e. `target="_blank"`), so that the wizard flow
  does not get fully interrupted.

## Estimate

* Apply `sharpen-background--green` to the `body` tag so that the entire page
  appears with the green background color. (Due to the limitations of
  Storybook, the background class in the story below has been applied to the
  container element.)
* This example uses chart.js to render a simple visualization of how the child
  might progress over three months.
